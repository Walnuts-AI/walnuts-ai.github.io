We want to be the first doing this and believe it is doable. Each of the team members is proud of and feels entitled when belonging to the team. In good faith, we have assembled a dream team, capable of compiling our vision into research and engineering plans, and bringing it to production under a realistic time frame. 

Our rockstar team is composed of three co-founders with Ph.D degrees, ten-year of multi-discipline experiences each. Their expertises complements one from another; each of the cofounders is an expert in their own fields: audio with voices and speech, text with languages and reasoning, images with perception and cognition. Our team members are all 10x engineers, experienced in publishing at top conferences and journals, worked in startup environments and big corps such as Google and Amazon, as well as being cofounders in previous ventures. We have known each other long, and now we share the ambition to disrupt the future of AI landscape, bringing AI to transform the society we live in, improve human lives and create more opportunities for everyone.
