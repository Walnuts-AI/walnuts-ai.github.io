We want to be the first doing this and believe it is doable. Each of the team members is proud of and feels entitled when belonging to the team. In good faith, we have assembled a dream team, capable of compiling our vision into research and engineering plans, and bringing it to production under a realistic time frame. 

Our team is composed of three co-founders with ten-year of multi-discipline experiences each. Our expertises complements one from another; each of the cofounders is an expert in their own fields: audio with voices and speech, text with languages and reasoning, images with perception and cognition. Team members have first-hand experiences in publishing at top conferences and journals, founding previous startups and working in top AI firms. We have known each other long before now and we commit to share the ambition of disrupting the AI landscape, bringing AI to transform the society we live in, improve human lives, diversity, and knowledge sharing.
